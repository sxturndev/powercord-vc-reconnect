# powercord-vc-reconnect
Since Powercord has reached EOL, this repository is now archived.

A powercord plugin that will attempt to disconnect/rejoin a voice chat if ping goes above a certain threshold.

This plugin was created to solve a specific ping spike issue with Discord. When reconnecting, Discord will find a new route/new server as an attempt to fix massive ping spikes.
